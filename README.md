# diceroller
An Android application to roll with n-sided dice

This app allows you to simulate rolling multiple dice that are common in
table-top RPG, including modifiers. E.g. you can roll a d20, or you can also
roll 3d6+5.

To avoid overcrowding the UI, you have a few defaults, and you can define a few
own configurations as shortcuts.

This project started out as a hobby project and will likely stay that way, so
don't expect much eyecandy or technical support. In due time I will create basic
docu though.
